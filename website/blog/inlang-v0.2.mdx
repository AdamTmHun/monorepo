## Transcript

Hello there,

inlang version 0.2 is out. The stated goal of Inlang is to build the standard solution to localize software.
Why? Because localizing software is not straightforward. It involves a lot of technical questions like, what SDK should I choose?
What localization syntax? How do I build a translation pipeline?
And non-technical questions like, well, the biggest one being who's actually going to do
the translations, but also, how do you maintain translations?
Inlang strives to build the standard solution to tackle all of
those problems, and we're doing that by building on top of Mozilla's
recently released Fluent.

### 1. Inlang is now built on top of Mozilla's Fluent system

Let me give you a brief introduction to Fluent and why we adopted it.
First and foremost, human languages are complex.
Mozilla observed multiple problems with existing localization syntaxes.
To solve those problems, Mozilla designed a dedicated syntax, file format,
a whole system whose sole purpose is to express human languages,
nothing more, nothing less. We think Fluent is the best bet to build
the standard solution for localizing software. If we are building the
standard solution, it should come with the best localization syntax.
Right now, that's Fluent built by tremendously experienced people
with over 20 years of experience in localizing software, namely Firefox.

```fluent
# Simple things are simple.
hello-user = Hello, {$userName}!

# Complex things are possible.
shared-photos =
    {$userName} {$photoCount ->
        [one] added a new photo
       *[other] added {$photoCount} new photos
    } to {$userGender ->
        [male] his stream
        [female] her stream
       *[other] their stream
    }.
```

### 2. Solve non-technical problems first

With version 0.2 comes a slight shift in focus. Inlang started out with trying
to solve technical problems first. However, technical problems are inherently more difficult
to solve than non-technical problems. Especially, if the sheer variatey of software stacks
needs to be considered. We are now focusing on the non technical questions first, specifically
how to maintain translations for a project.
