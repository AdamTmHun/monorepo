# Introduction

## Current State

Inlang reduces the effort to localize software by enabling non-technical team members, or translators, to manage translations without touching source-code. Developers are reliefed from managing translations and can focus on writing code. Changes are synchronized with inlang which enables translators to do their work without contact between developers and translators.

## The Future

Inlang strives build an ecosystem around Fluent and standardize localization of software. The current features are a small subset of features and tools required to achieve the formulated goal. Localizing software consists of multiple minor inconveniences like non-existend typesafety, collaboration via email, fragmented tooling that merge into a giant pile of problems. The consequence is to not localize software, despite major benefits like substantial increase in traffic (SEO) and conversions.

Localizing (translating) software should be straightforward.
