# Adapters

Inlang is build around [Mozilla's Fluent system](https://projectfluent.org) with the intention
of making Fluent the standard localization syntax. The system was developed by Mozilla to address
[shortcomings of other localization syntaxes](https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent/wiki/Fluent-and-ICU-MessageFormat).

**Inlang supports other syntaxes through adapters.** Adapters convert specified i18n syntaxes to and from
Fluent syntax. The latter entails that not every functionality that Fluent/inlang supports is supported
by every adapter (due to syntax features) and vice-versa.

:::caution
Only syntax that fluent supports can be supported by adapters. For example, Fluent only supports one
nested layer of attributes i.e. an `id` with two layers named `login.button.close` won't work.
See the [Fluent syntax specification](https://projectfluent.org/fluent/guide/).
