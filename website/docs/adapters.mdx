# Adapters

Inlang is build around [Mozilla's Fluent syntax](https://projectfluent.org) with the intention
of making Fluent the standard localization syntax. The syntax was developed by Mozilla to address
[shortcomings of other localization syntaxes](https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent/wiki/Fluent-and-ICU-MessageFormat).

**Inlang supports other syntaxes through adapters.** Adapters convert specified i18n syntaxes to and from
Fluent syntax. The latter entails that not every functionality that Fluent/inlang supports is supported
by every adapter (due to syntax features) and vice-versa.
