# Inlang v0.2 is out. More or less rewritten from scratch.

## What changed?

- **Inlang is now built on top of and around Mozilla's new Fluent system.**  
  Standardizing the localization process starts with standardizing the file format. Mozilla recently released [Fluent](https://projectfluent.org),
  a dedicated system solely to express human languages and solve problems with other i18n systems (file formats). While not perfect,
  it seems to be the best format and system to build an ecosystem around. [Here](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/04/fluent-1-0-a-localization-system-for-natural-sounding-translations/)
  is a deeper article about Fluent.
- **Everything, including the dashboard, acts directly on parsed translation files instead of a (relational) database.**  
  The problems inlang tries to solve are difficult and the solutions not obvious. By building the dashboard (the localization problem)
  to act on top of parsed files, code can be shared with the developer tools (internationalization problem) for the time being.

## The goal of inlang

With v0.2 the goal of inlang takes a concreter shape: **Make internationalization and localization of software X times faster through standardization, developer tools and automation.**
Starting by explaining the difference between those two terms.
Wikipedia describes the differences as following

> Internationalization is the process of designing a software application
> so that it can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes.
> Localization is the process of adapting internationalized software for a specific region
> or language by translating text and adding locale-specific components. [0]

**Internationalizing software should be plug and play, yet it's not.** Every programming language,
framework and library comes with its own solutions to something that should be straightforward:
Text in source code should be displayed in the corresponding language of the user.
It's less frustrating to set up Stripe than to set up internationalization.
Inlang is out there to change that status quo by building a series of developer
tools starting with the [VSCode extension](https://github.com/inlang/inlang/tree/main/apps/vs-code-extension).

**Localizing software (content) involves tons of manual tasks that are screaming to be automated**: hand-offs via email,
collaboration via excel spreadsheets, no (automated) Q&A pipelines, no version control, the list goes on.
Inlang is going to address that problem space too.
Version 0.2 eliminates hand-offs and collaboration via excel spreadsheets.

<Callout>
  Inlang is early and by no means has found the best answers to address the
  problems mentioned above. Take [part in the
  discussions](https://github.com/inlang/inlang/discussions) and help make
  internationalization and localization easier than setting up Stripe.

## History

### September 2021: Proof of Concept II

The previous proof of concept was limited to specific web-frameworks like NextJS and SvelteKit. It became clear
that for most software stacks, having the translations living in the source code is ensured more compatibility.

The proof of concept II made use of a GitHub integration to commit translation file (changes) to source code
instead of relying on SSR. The app still "reported" missing translations, the main pain that got me started
working on inlang.

### Early August 2021: "Can't i18n be easier?" Proof of Concept posted on Reddit

By the time of the reddit post, I had an IoT company with a B2C app that had to be offered in German and English. Even though I am fluent
in German (and somewhat) English, internationalizing the app was a pain. I used the summer break to develop a proof of concept which
would solve one of my main pains: missing translations.

To solve the problem, I had a relatively simple idea. Why does the app not "report" the translations it needs?

Btw, I did not plan to develop inlang further after that reddit post. I was about to start my masters
and knew I would be easily distracted otherwise. However, by coincidance, my proof of concept and myself ended up as part
of project within my masters which meant the further development of inlang, and touch√©e, dropping out of my masters.
