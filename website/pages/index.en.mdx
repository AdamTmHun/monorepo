# Localizing software should be straightforward

Collaboration via email/excel, fragmented developer tooling, non-existent or manual quality assurance pipelines,
the list goes on ... Localizing software leads to a giant pile of small problems which merge into one gigantic problem.
The consequence? Companies are not localizing their software.

**Inlangs goal** is to change the status quo of localizing software by building an ecosystem around [Mozilla's
Fluent system](https://projectfluent.org) and thereby standardize the localization process of software.

## What you get today

**No more handoff:** Inlang reduces the effort of localizing software by enabling non-technical team members,
or translators, to manage translations without touching source-code. Developers are reliefed
from managing translations and can focus on writing code.

_Translations can be created, edited and managed in the dashboard without touching source code or contacting a developer._
