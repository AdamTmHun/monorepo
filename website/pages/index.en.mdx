# Localizing software should be straightforward

Collaboration via email/excel, fragmented developer tooling, non-existent or manual quality assurance pipelines,
the list goes on ... Localizing software leads to a giant pile of small problems which merge into one gigantic problem.
The consequence? Companies are not localizing their software.

**Inlangs goal:**  
Build an ecosystem around [Mozilla's Fluent system](https://projectfluent.org) and thereby
standardize the localization process of software.
