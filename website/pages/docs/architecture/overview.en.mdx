# Overview

In addition to the sections below, [the source code](https://github.com/inlang/inlang) is full of additional READMEs and
one of the best recourses to understand the architecture behind inlang more in-depth.

## Everything is a file

Inlangs architecture is designed to accomodate two different
problem spaces with as much overlap as possible:

1. Developer facing (source code) solutions.  
   Developers are responsible for feeding translations into the software (i18n).

2. Translation management (cloud) solutions.  
   Translations need to be created and managed.

The first problem is inherently a file based problem. Whether translation files live in source
code, or are fetched from an API: A data format (aka file) is needed to load translations into software.
By building the translation management solutions to act on (parsed) files (as AST) instead of
leveraging a classical relational database schema, the majority of code can be shared between
those two problem spaces. Leading to synergy effects with each update.

## Build on top of Fluent

Mozilla's recently released localization system [Fluent](https://projectfluent.org) is the best bet to standardize
the localization process of software. In a nutshell, it's a dedicated system (syntax, file format etc.)
soleley to express human languages. Nothing more, nothing less. By defining the scope of the system soleley
to express human languages, it solves many edge cases and nuance problems with existing localization systems.
For more in-depth information about Fluent, follow [this link](https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent/wiki/Fluent-and-ICU-MessageFormat).

## Support for file formats other than Fluent

While Fluent is great and we hope to uplift it to the standard localization format, a lot of software
out there is using different translation file formats such as [ICU](https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent/wiki/Fluent-and-ICU-MessageFormat).
To accomdodate those software projects, and increase adoption of Fluent, inlang provides Fluent Syntax
Converters ([@inlang/fluent-format-converters](https://github.com/inlang/inlang/tree/main/packages/fluent-format-converters)).

  Only features that Fluent supports can be supported by converters. For
  example, Fluent only supports one nested layer of attributes i.e. an `id` with
  two layers named `login.button.close` won't work. See the [Fluent syntax
  specification](https://projectfluent.org/fluent/guide/).

## Open source

Inlang strives to foster an ecosystem around Fluent. To do so, inlang itself is open source and broken into
smaller packages (see [inlang/packages](https://github.com/inlang/inlang/tree/main/packages)).
We hope that those packages help developers extend the ecosystem and build solutions for their own needs.
