# Getting Started

You can setup inlang in three ways:

1.  0:00 Increase developer productivity via the VSCode extension.
2.  1:47 Let non-technical team members and translators manage translations.
3.  Both of the above :)

<Callout>
  Inlang is build on top of [Mozilla's Fluent system](https://projectfluent.org/). In case you intend
  to use inlang with an i18n syntax/file format other than Fluent, please refer to
  [using a converter](docs/architecture/overview#support-for-file-formats-other-than-fluent).

In case you want to localize your app from scratch, use an [i18n library that supports Fluent](https://github.com/inlang/awesome-fluent).

2. Run `npx inlang init` (node must be installed) in the terminal.

## Translation Management (takes 2 minutes)

1. Create a project in [the dashboard](https://app.inlang.dev).
2. Import your translations either via copy & paste or [the CLI](/docs/reference/cli-reference).
