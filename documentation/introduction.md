## Main features

### Infrastructure approach

For every use case, there is an app, a plugin, a lint rule, or a custom solution that can be built. Inlang's infrastructure powers an ecosystem of tools, applications, best practices, and automationsÂ for organizations to go global.

### Version control and automation via CI/CD

Inlang apps are built on lix. Lix is a git-compatible version control backend for applications. Using lix provides inlang with CI/CD for globalization and collaboration between developers, translators, and designers on one common source of truth: your repository and your data.
