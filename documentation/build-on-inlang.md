# {% $frontmatter.title %}

**Inlang is designed to build upon with the `@inlang/core` package.**

The [@inlang/core](https://github.com/inlang/inlang/tree/main/source-code/core) package is all one needs to build an app, a GitHub action, a CLI, an SDK, and more. All inlang apps themselves use the `@inlang/core` package.

**The documentation is work in progress.** Reach out via [discussions](https://github.com/inlang/inlang/discussions) or email `hello@inlang.com` if you have questions.
