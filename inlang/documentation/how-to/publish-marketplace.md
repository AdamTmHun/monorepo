# Publish to the marketplace

Publishing your own plugin or lint rule to the [marketplace](/) is straightforward, as the only thing you have to add to our item registry is the URL of your `marketplace-manifest.json`.

## Pre-requisites

- [jsdelivr URL](https://www.jsdelivr.com/github) (other CDN's are not supported)
- A developed [app](/documentation/develop-app), [plugin](/documentation/develop-plugin), or [lint rule](/documentation/develop-lint-rule)

## Step-by-step

### 1. Add the information to your marketplace manifest
Adding the marketplace information is necessary for the marketplace to display your item correctly. You can use these category-specific templates:
- [Manifest template for apps](/documentation/develop-app#4.-configure-your-app)
- [Manifest template for lint rules](/documentation/develop-lint-rule#3.-configure-your-lint-rule)
- [Manifest template for plugins](/documentation/develop-plugin#3.-configure-your-plugin)

#### Official JSON schema

You can ensure that your manifest is valid by loading the following schema. 

``` json
"$schema": "https://inlang.com/schema/marketplace-manifest"
```

#### Naming your item
| **Parameter**        | **Convention**                                               |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`                 | The unique identifier should always be written in camelCase like this: `camelCase.camelCase.camelCase`                         |
| `displayName`                 | Please follow the [Apple Style Guide](https://support.apple.com/de-de/guide/applestyleguide/apsgb744e4a3/web) and write the first letter of a new word in the title always in uppercase, e.g. `Language Tag`. **Rule of thumb:** The first letter of the first word always has to be uppercase, except your displayName is a name written in lowercase letters everywhere else like `npm` for example.                       |
| `description`                 | Please make sure to describe your item as simple as possible. It is best practice to write 100 to 200 characters.                         |
`readme`                 | The readme acts as documentation for your item and is written in markdown. Feel free to use github flavored markdown, additionally you use inlang's custom web components (doc-elements).                      |
`keywords`                 | Keywords are always written in lowercase e.g. `i18n`, `adoptable` â€¦                          |

#### Custom web components

| Element        | Attribute   | Description                                                | Required |
|----------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| `<doc-figure>` | src         | Source to the image file.                                  | Yes      |
|                | alt         | Alternative text for screen readers.                       | Yes      |
|                | caption     | Caption shown below the image.                             | Yes      |
| `<doc-icon>`   | icon        | [Iconify](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/) icon tag.     | Yes      |
|                | size        | The size of the icon.                                      | Yes      |
| `<doc-link>`   | title       | The title for the document link.                           | Yes      |
|                | icon        | [Iconify](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/) icon tag.     | Yes      |
|                | href        | The link behind the document link.                         | Yes      |
|                | description | The description shown in the quick link.                   | Yes      |

This format reduces repetition by listing common attributes for each element under the respective element's section.

### 2. Add the link to your marketplace manifest to the registry

Add the raw link of your manifest to [this file](https://github.com/inlang/monorepo/blob/main/inlang/source-code/marketplace-registry/registry.json). You can fork the repository to do so.

### 3. Create a pull request and wait for approval

Create a pull request with your changes and wait for approval from our team. Usually, this will take less than 24 hours. After that, your item will be available in the marketplace.
