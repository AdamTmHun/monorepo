# An inspiration for how to style product pages on inlang.com

In this guide, I want to show you how we at inlang are styling product pages. 

### ‚ùó Please note

It is completely up to you how you want to style your product pages. This is just an inspiration for you to get started.

## How we style product pages

We are using an engaging header image with up to three key features of the product. If it is important to the product, we introduce a `Getting started` section beforehand. 

I have created an illustration for you to see how we are styling our product pages:
