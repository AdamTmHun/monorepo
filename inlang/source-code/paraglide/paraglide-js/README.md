# @inlang/paraglide-js

Paraglide JS is the i18n library for inlang projects. 

Under the hood, Paraglide JS compiles an inlang project into a use-case optimized i18n library. The keyword is "compiles". By leveraging a compiler, Paraglide JS eliminates a class of edge cases while also being simpler, faster, and more reliable than other i18n libraries. Oh, and it's also typesafe :)
