# How to use

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Setup

Create a `project.inlang.json` in the **root** of your project. You can use the following template when using json files as translation files, if not, please look for other [supported resource file types](https://inlang.com/marketplace):

```json
{
	// official schema ensures that your project file is valid
	"$schema": "https://inlang.com/project-config-schema",
	// the "source" language tag that is used in your project
	"sourceLanguageTag": "en",
	// all the language tags you want to support in your project
	"languageTags": ["en", "de"],
	"modules": [],
	"settings": {}
}
```

#### Requirements:

- Requires VS Code version 1.80.1 or higher.
- Node.js version 16.17.1 or higher.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Usage

Just _highlight/select_ the text you want and hit `cmd .` or `ctrl +` (Quick Fix / Yellow Bulb) to open the **translate dialog** to provide a id for it.

Hover over the message to see the tooltip with the translation.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Configuration

You can configure the extension to your needs by defining the `ideExtension` property in the config.

| Property                   | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `messageReferenceMatchers` | `Array` | An array of functions that define matchers for message references inside the code. Each function takes an argument of type `{ documentText: string }` and returns a promise that resolves to an array of message references (as defined by the `messageReferenceSchema`).                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `extractMessageOptions`    | `Array` | An array of objects that define options for extracting messages. Each object has a property `callback` that is a function which is called when the user finishes the message extraction command. The `callback` function takes two arguments of type `string`: `messageId` (the message identifier entered by the user) and `selection` (the text which was extracted), and returns a `string` that represents the code which should be inserted into the document. |
| `documentSelectors`        | `Array` | An array of [VS Code DocumentSelectors](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/document-selector) that specify for which files/programming languages the extension should be activated. Each document selector is an object with optional properties `language`, `scheme`, `pattern`, and `notebookType`.                                                                                                                                                     |

For this example, the extension parses strings with a `t` translation function & gives the according extract options `{t("messageID")}` & `t("messageID")`.
You can fully customize this behavior.
