# Lix (previously Project Lisa)

Lix is the git compatible data storage for applications with an "edit > review > automate" workflow.

We build lix to bring developers and non technical editors together without sacrificing the power of full change control.

"Change control" is like version control, but giving apps the options to stay out of the way, be faster and also support more complex formats and derived assets.

Examples for great lix apps (some require a later binary support layer):
  - markdown editors
  - bookkeeping
  - editors for manuals
  - figma files
  - versioned spreadsheets
  - CAD
  - jupyter notebooks or linked datasets
  - colocated bug tickets in an sqlite db in the repo
