# Lix (previously Project Lisa)

Lix is a change control system for applications.

We build lix to bring developers and non technical editors together without sacrificing either control about consistency nor forcing many manual steps on editors as in classic git workflows (Eg. checkout, named branching, manual commits with messages, stashing, rebasing, pushing)

Apart from these advantages, we can also improve performance with lazy actions, support more complex formats and derived assets and offer fully integrated review workflows.

Examples for great lix apps have a "edit > review > automate" workflow (some require a later binary support layer):

- markdown editors
- bookkeeping
- editors for manuals
- figma files
- versioned spreadsheets
- CAD
- jupyter notebooks or linked datasets
- colocated bug tickets in an sqlite db in the repo
