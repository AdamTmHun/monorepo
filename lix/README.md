# Lix (previously Project Lisa)

Lix is a change control system for applications.

Change control allows tracking and querying changes.
This allows us to answer questions like how did a function or a specific key in a json file change over time.

Apart from these advantages, we can also improve performance with lazy actions, support more complex formats and derived assets and offer fully integrated review workflows.

Examples for great lix apps have a "edit > review > automate" workflow (some require a later binary support layer):

- markdown editors
- bookkeeping
- editors for manuals
- figma files
- versioned spreadsheets
- CAD
- jupyter notebooks or linked datasets
- colocated bug tickets in an sqlite db in the repo
