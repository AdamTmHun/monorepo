# inlang Marketplace

inlang's Marketplace provides you with apps, plugins and lint rules for your next project. You can use the filter options to find the right item for your project.

## How to publish to the Marketplace

If you have created a plugin or lint rule, you can publish it to the Marketplace in three easy steps:

### 1️⃣ Add the necessary `marketplace` property to your plugin or lint-rule.

### 2️⃣ Add the link to your `plugin` or `lint-rule` module to the registry

Add your module to [this file](https://github.com/inlang/inlang/blob/main/source-code/marketplace/registry.json) via a PR.

### 3️⃣ Create a pull request and wait for approval

Create a pull request with your changes and wait for approval. After that, your plugin or lint rule will be available in the marketplace.
