## Apps

> :bulb: The apps and features you see below are the features that are available right now. More is planned.


### [Editor](apps/dashboard)  
Let non-technical team members and translators manage translations for you.

![dashboard-example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35429197/154271089-9acf02c3-7c6e-435c-9014-6ee21426ab4d.png)

- Interface built on top of Git
 --> Integrate into existing CI/CD pipelines ✅
- Based on local files --> you keep control over your data ✅
- Get warnings for missing translations ✅
- The source of truth: your repository ✅


Validated translations go right back to Git where the rest of your code-base lives. No unnecessary data pipelines and integrations needed.

> In-progress features:
> - In-editor rendering of your site/application so translators keep proper context of translations in mind.
> - Immutable variables in the translations to prevent translators from changing them while still getting the necessary context

### [VS-Code-Extension](apps/vs-code-extension)  
Improve developers' workflows by (semi)automating repetitive tasks. 

Extract and show patterns directly in your IDE. 


> :bulb: The VS Code extension works independently of the dashboard and CLI.
