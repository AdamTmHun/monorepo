## Apps

> :bulb: The apps and features you see below are the features that are available right now. More is planned.


### [dashboard](apps/dashboard)  
Let non-technical team members and translators manage translations for you.

![dashboard-example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35429197/154271089-9acf02c3-7c6e-435c-9014-6ee21426ab4d.png)


### [vs-code-extension](apps/vs-code-extension)  
Extract and show patterns directly in your IDE. 

> :bulb: The VS Code extension works independently of the dashboard and CLI.
