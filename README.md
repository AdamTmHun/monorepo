# Inlang

Inlang is an open source localization solution for software build on top [Mozilla's Fluent project](https://projectfluent.org/).

## Goals

## Status

[x] Collaboration on translations with non-technical team members or translators.  
[x] Machine translations.  
[x] Linting of translations (in the dashboard).  
[x] Synchronize translations (via the CLI or Copy & Paste).  
[] Over the air updates without releasing a new version of your app.  
[] Self-hostable, see [this discussion](https://github.com/inlang/inlang/discussions/65).
