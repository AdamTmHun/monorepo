## Getting started

TODO - link to documentation


## Demo

### Step 1 - Create keys directly in VSCode
Keys are automatically sent to the dashboard, machine translated into all languages and synced with your source code. Bonus on top: typesafety (no more missing translations/none existent keys).

### Step 2 - Manage translations in the dashboard
Collaborators, or you yourself, can seamlessly edit translations in the dashboard. During development the translations are automatically synced with the source code.
