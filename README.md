Increase i18n and localization productivity with dev tools, an editor to manage translations, and automation via CI/CD. Inlang turns your git repository into the single source of truth for localization:

- [x] no synchronization pipelines required.
- [x] automation via CI/CD.
- [x] avoid silos between developers and translators.

## Editor

Let non-technical team members (translators) manage messages in a repository. The editor is a baby of VSCode and Figma, combining a git based editor with a web-based and simple to use editor.

## Dev tools

Inlang is designed to be extended, the dev tools below are a small selection of dev tools that are maintained by inlang. With the [@inlang/core module](https://inlang.com/documentation/build-on-inlang), you are able to build tools according your needs. Read more about the [infrastructure design principle](https://inlang.com/documentation/design-principles).

### IDE-Extension ([get notified](https://tally.so/r/wgbOpJ))

Improve developers' productivity by (semi)automating repetitive tasks like the extraction of messages, seeing localization related errors directly in the IDE and more.
