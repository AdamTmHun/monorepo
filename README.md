Inlang provides developer-frist localization infrastructure consisting of dev tools, an editor to manage translations, and automation via CI/CD. Your git repository is the single source of truth for localization.

- [x] No lock-in.
- [x] One-click setup.
- [x] Use CI/CD for automation.
- [x] Avoid silos between developers and translators.

For a technical explanation of the architecture, read [RFC-001](https://github.com/inlang/inlang/pull/127).
