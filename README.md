       A git-based software localization system

#

Inlang is a localization system that acknowledges git repositories as the single source of truth, utilizes CI/CD pipelines of repositories for automation, and extends git to close collaboration gaps between developers and translators.

Inlang works "on-top-of" the translation files in your repository so you keep full control of your data with no lock-in effect. Validated translations go right back to your git-repo where the rest of your code-base lives. No unnecessary data pipelines and integrations needed.

This leads to one single source of truth: your repository âœ…

Useful features such as warnings for missing translations, or  immutable placeholders for variables are pleasant extras to the fundamental advantage of Inlang's git-based architecture.  

## Apps

> :bulb: The apps and features you see below are the features that are available right now. More is planned.


### [Editor](apps/dashboard)  
Let non-technical team members and translators manage translations for you.

![dashboard-example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35429197/154271089-9acf02c3-7c6e-435c-9014-6ee21426ab4d.png)

> In-progress features:
> - In-editor rendering of your site/application so translators keep proper context of translations in mind.

### [VS-Code-Extension](apps/vs-code-extension)  
Improve developers' workflows by (semi)automating repetitive tasks. 

Extract and show patterns directly in your IDE. 


> :bulb: The VS Code extension works independently of the dashboard and CLI.
