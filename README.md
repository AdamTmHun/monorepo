## Internationalization (i18n) of apps is too hard.


This project strives to lower the barrier(s) of i18ing your apps. What started out as a simple [tech demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xzbc6QYzDs) turned into a bigger project of 6 students from the Technical University of Denmark. We are participating in [X-Tech](https://www.entrepreneurship.dtu.dk/education/x-tech-entrepreneurship) and have 10 weeks to build an MVP, helping you to i18n your app.

### We need your help
We have to identify what we should build. Help us by participating in [discussions](https://github.com/samuelstroschein/inlang/discussions), open issues, propose ideas, and most importantly, share the pain(s) you experienced with current i18n solutions, or why you did not i18n your app yet.

## Current state: proof of concept

> :warning:	Do not use this on production apps. Expect breaking changes.
