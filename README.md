# Inlang

Inlang is an open source localization solution for software build on top [Mozilla's Fluent project](https://projectfluent.org/).

## Goal

Develop the standard solution to localize software.

## Status

[x] Alpha: Sufficient to manage translations for apps. Exploration phase to determine additional features.  
[ ] Beta: Sufficient for medium sized software projects with multiple components.  
[ ] Release: Production ready.

## Features

[x] Collaboration on translations with non-technical team members or translators.  
[x] Machine translations.  
[x] Linting of translations (in the dashboard).  
[x] Synchronize translations (via the CLI or Copy & Paste).  
[] Over the air updates without releasing a new version of your app.  
[] Self-hostable, see [this discussion](https://github.com/inlang/inlang/discussions/65).
